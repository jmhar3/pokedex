# pokedex
Welcome to my first JavaScript project. A Pokemon catalogue where you can search first gen Pokemon by name or type. Clicking on a Pokemon will reveal it's stats.

Are you ready to play... WHO'S THAT POKEMON?

How I Worked On This Project...
My goal was to develop my Frontend Developement abilities.
- I designed a Pokemon catalogue based on the Pokedex
- I built several features such as the ability to search by name or type and clicking to reveal stats

Why I Built The Project This Way...

If I Had More Time I Would Change This...
- Set up a feature that enables you to add a pokemon to your collection
- Streamline the code to be more readable
